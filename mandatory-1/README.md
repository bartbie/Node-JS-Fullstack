# Mandatory I assignment solution
*This README is short due to bigger documentation being part of the solution itself.*

## dependencies installation

run 

```sh
npm install
```

## running the project with Express.js

run

```sh
npm run express
```

or just `./run.sh`

## running in hot-reload mode (no Express.js running)

run

```sh
npm run dev
```

The project runs on port `3000` (yes, it's hardcoded).
