# Hi there!
Welcome to my docs! I've created this site ~~because i had to~~ to document what was on my NodeJS Fullstack course.
## Requirements for this project

### code:
- Serve the pages with Express.
- Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR). 
- Split up the documentation in pages rather than one long HTML page.
- Should have some nice styling (custom or with a styling framework).

### documentation:
- Should contain terminal commands.
- Should contain code snippets.
- Should contain all the tools we’ve used and explain them.
- Should cover all the theory that we’ve touched upon.

### admin page specifically:
- Create (a) login/signup page(s). 
- The admin panel should allow users to fill out the content for a new documentation page in the browser. This means input fields and text areas.

## How did i achieve it then?

I've written my app using Astro.js framework that acts as a SSR middleware for Express.js app

## Try it yourself!
To get started you just need to run either of those commands:
- use the run script located inside root folder `./run.sh` from your terminal
- use the command defined for the package: `npm run express`

### Read rest of the documentation to get how it was created!
